          <strong>Anna Bolla: </strong><p>My name is Anna Bolla, I am a fashion designer, concert photographer, and all around great person.</p>
        
        <p><strong>TD:</strong> Love.</p>
        
        <p><strong>AB:</strong> Weird laughing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>TD:</strong> <em>*weird laughing*</em> Today I'm gonna be interviewing Anna about a couple trinkets that she has and we're gonna talk about what these memorabilia, what role do they play in your brain—not in your life—in your brain and we're gonna pick your brain.</p>
        
        <p><strong>AB:</strong> Okay, I'm so ready, yay, consider me an open brain.</p>
        
        <p><strong>TD:</strong> Well, what is your first trinket that you're bringing in today if you could describe it because there's no video.</p>
        
        <p><strong>AB:</strong> Well, I guess I'll go in chronological order of when these impacted my life I suppose. So, first trinket is the SAAB labeling that was ripped off the back of my childhood car. It's silver and black and it says SAAB spelled S-A-A-B.</p>
        
        <p><strong>TD:</strong> So why did you choose this, why was it something you thought of?</p>
        
        <p><strong>AB:</strong> This was given to me about a few months ago from my mother. This was my childhood car growing up. They don't make SAABs anymore, they're illegal in the US now. We had a convertible, my parents had it for 20
        
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> Aww, that is very lovely.</p>
  
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Yes, love SAABs, anything else you want to know?</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> Is there anything else you want to say about it?</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Ummmm no I guess not.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> Amazing, let's hold space for SAAB.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Okay okay, my next object is a keychain of, it used to be hot pink it is now a little bit dirty.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> It's a little purple.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> This is a little monster figurine, about the size of a pinky finger. It's hot pink, it has a little knob, it's like one big blob and then two blobs for arms, two blobs for feet and a little blob on the head. Maybe it's like a little chef hat. And then it has two eyes, but they are vertical not horizontal and then a little black smile. I got this at my most favourite sleepaway summer camp when I was younger. It was called Camp Evazion. I went for four summers in a row, two weeks each summer. It was a sleepaway sports camp. We also had a camp Olympics — everyone was split into teams and earned points through daily events. On the final day at the camp dance, the winners were announced.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> My first year I went with my brother and our friends — the siblings were our ages, so we were all best friends. Me and my friend Julie were technically too young to be there, but they let us go because our older siblings were attending. Since we couldn’t participate in the challenges, we were made team mascots. One day during an arts and crafts challenge, they gave me this and another little monster keychain like its sibling. I've had it on every set of keys I’ve ever owned and I’m never getting rid of it.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> I love it, I love these little monster guys.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Ya, they are so cute.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> I remember my bestie Emily from California had a bunch of these and she gave me one, they're so cute.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Ya.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> And then Soso tore it up.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Ya, it reminds me of my life in France which is my favorite time of my life, and like just the best memories before life had problems. So they are all related — I give them a little squeeze every time I take them out of my pocket. And it's soft, so when I have my keys or wallet in a bag I just feel for something soft and then I know that I've found it.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> I really like that one, it is really really precious.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Thank you, do you have anything else you want to know about him?</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> Do you have this matching with somebody you said?</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> No I had two, I don't know where the other one is.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> Did your friend at camp get another one?</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> I think she did.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> Do you think she still has it?</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> No, we are not really talking anymore. We still are in contact, but she was kind of the friend growing up that was really mean to everyone and thought that they could boss everyone around and then everyone decided to not be friends with her anymore. But I love her sister to death. But I can't really be that close of friends with her anymore because then it would cause problems.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> Ok, next one.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> This is a, I want to say a Cadillac, this is like the front of a Cadillac molding. It is baby pink, it has red headlamps and it's spiky. It has silver accenting. And it actually is a calculator, and it's working. You can do all sorts of calculations on this thing and then you can flip it closed and just leave it as a little book stopper. That's what I used to use it as.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> This came into my life almost three years ago now, which is crazy. Because it literally feels like yesterday... actually no, two years, coming on to two years. I had just graduated high school and I was going on a trip with my two coworkers at the time, who were my best friends — Anna and Caroline — shout out to them.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> Name drop!!</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> I love them to death, both of them. We were doing a trip around Europe. Our stops were London, Paris, my hometown in Echenevex, then we went to [missing place] in northern Italy on Lago De Garda, then Padova and Venice where my aunt lives. Then we went to Rome, then up to Bologna for a day, and then back to Rome to fly out.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> We were staying with friends and family to save money — it was an incredible time. I found the Cadillac calculator on our last day in London. Me and Caroline got up really early to go to this flower market — it was like a flea market but only sold flowers. We went into a little antique store and I found this. I thought it was beautiful, then opened it and saw it was a calculator and freaked out. Then I realized it worked and I freaked out even more. It was 12 pounds — an incredible price for an incredible find. I think it might be the only souvenir I bought on that trip, which lasted two months. Probably the best trip of my life.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> I really enjoyed another trip to Budapest and Vienna with Caroline, but this Europe trip was life-changing. It taught me a lot about myself and how I work. It showed me I have healthy relationships in my life — we were all adults and we love each other very much. We coexisted, which I hadn’t really experienced before. It made me feel warm and lovely inside. I love them to death — we’re actually in a band.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> Can you coexist with this car calculator as your relationship is going on for two years?</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Ya, I think we're working well together. We used to share a room but now we are in separate rooms, but we see each other every day. I could see us moving back into the same room. It’s just that we both needed a little bit more space.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> It is a healthy balance.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Ya, so we just kind of move back and forth and I'm excited for the rest of our relationship to evolve.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> A healthy balance from a healthy part of your life.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Yes.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> I love that, that's beautiful.</p>
          
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Mhmm.</p>
          
          <p><strong>TD:</strong> And what's next, my dear friend?</p>
  
          <p><strong>AB:</strong> Next is going to be this. The last two have both come into my life very recently actually. This next one is a little guy I got for Christmas this year from my mother. It is Gizmo from *Gremlins* in a little Santa hat and he is sitting inside the box that he came in with little Christmas lights, and he actually plays music. He does his little singing and his lights light up in sync. That's what he sings to help calm himself down when everything goes really chaotic in the movie.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> *Gremlins* has been one of my most beloved and favourite films for my entire life as long as I can remember. It's one of the ones that I go back to over and over again, I own it in many different forms. And this character is one that I have always loved and admired so much and I just think it's incredible — just like a reminder of my love for film, as well as my being grateful that my mom got it for me.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> I've eaten many meals with him staring right at me.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> Yes, he sits on our shelf so he looks at us. A lot of the trinkets we have just kind of watch.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> Peek. I'm actually staring at myself right now and I look quite hunky dory. I think that this one — and this is going to tie to your next one that you're going to show — because you like to give trinkets, which is really nice. And I think that receiving a trinket, it's nice to feel seen in that way of being given something that you are like, “oh my gosh yes you know me.”</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> Yes, I am very bad at receiving gifts. I think because I feel like my whole life I have never gotten a gift that made me feel like someone understood me. So I just would rather not receive gifts, but we're working through it. Kind of. Until someone gives me a good gift. I have received many gifts that I love a lot, but sometimes I feel like people know me better than they do and then I expect more than they have to give — which is not on them, a lot of the time it’s on me and my unrealistic expectations. But I just have a lot of problems in my head, I don't know if that's what you're looking to get into right now.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> Well, I guess that this is different because I am not very materialistic. My love language is not gift giving. I don’t want to say I'm bad at giving gifts but I just don't find huge meaning in it. I'm like, “okay, you got me a gift, but it's my birthday — of course people get gifts on birthdays.” That's just how I am. But yeah, I think sometimes people get gifts, but a lot of times gifts are more a reflection of how somebody thinks they see you. And I don't think I've gotten a lot of gifts that I’m like, “oh my god, you get me.” It's more like, you think I would like this — but really it has more to do with you than me.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> Should we move on?</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> Yes mama.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> Ok, this last trinket, I got like a month or two ago. At this lovely shop in Williamsburg called Mother of Junk.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> Owner’s a bitch.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> The owner is a bitch, but I love the name, I love the place, I kind of love that she's a bitch. I think it adds to the spunk of the place.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> And I hope she is well.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> I don't really hope she's well.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> She's a bitch with a backstory.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> I found this and it is siblings in the child toy box that was in the middle of the aisle. It's a little figure made of wood that is kind of doing a squat with its arms out. He's wearing an orange sweatband, his mouth is kind of like wide open and he's like kind of going “ooo!” He has an orange and yellow and white tank with stripes and polka dots, and his pants are like capris with the same colorway — stripes and circles — and he's got little brown boots on.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> I bought ten of these and distributed them amongst my closest friends here in New York for whichever ones I felt matched their personalities — which I feel like I have found myself doing a lot recently. I've never been someone who loves getting gifts for people on holidays — like I don't really enjoy getting people birthday or Christmas presents because it feels very forced. But I think one of my love languages is definitely gift giving, but in a way of like, when I see something that reminds me of you, I am just going to get it. It doesn't really matter if there is a rhyme or reason. But when it comes to birthdays and Christmas I am not very good at that.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> Same.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> Ya, so I gifted these to my beautiful flatmates, Temperance and April, and to three of my lovely ladies, Amalie, Clara, and Tanzie. And then to my baby girl Tatiana and one to my friend LJ. And the one that I have — actually my best friend Ani was in town for like five days and I happened to find two of the same ones. Our whole life — I've known her since I was 6 months old and she was born—</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> You held her when she was born.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> Yes, her parents are my parents’ best friends and our whole life people have thought we were twins. And so now we have matching little figurines that she has on her desk back in Chicago and I have on my desk here.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> That's so cute.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> They all stack and do gymnastics with each other because they have different positions, which is fun. It's like an interweaving and entanglement of my life here in New York and how I am starting to kind of find my circle of people that I would love to spend my life with.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TD:</strong> Yes I will marry you.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AB:</strong> heh heh</p>

      <p><strong>CSE:</strong> Durham University in England. mate. </p>
  
      <p><strong>TD:</strong>  That's bloody awesome. All right, today I'm interviewing my dear friend from XiangGang, -um Hong Kong.-, and Catherine picked out five trinkets that she will be talking about today and we're going to have a conversation about trinkets and what they mean to you, okay? </p>
  
      <p><strong>CSE:</strong> Yes, okay. </p>
  
      <p><strong>TD:</strong> All right, if you want to just start with your first one. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Oh. Oh, okay, I see one. Yay. I'm gonna start with the short glass. Hey shot glass, short glass. Short glass. Um, where I got this, well basically I collect shot glasses okay and so one of them's from my homeland Hong Kong and it reminds me of home. </p>
  
      <p><strong>TD:</strong> Where'd you get it? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Stanley Market, of course. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Oh my gosh. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Damn it is ugly. But I have this oh, no, wait, we're doing an interview. I can't do this right now. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Okay, but the one that you have is so like we go live it up, with them Hong Kong kids. What's his name, Skibbs?</p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong>  Skibbs. I love showing that video too. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> I've showed it to April, I am like guys like this is Hong Kong I like I actually love that song. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I remember we listened to it on our, okay, this is like not really part of the interview, but I remember vividly listening to it in the taxi on my phone, we were just playing it out loud all singing and in really short dresses and we were so out of pocket.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>  Oh my God. We were twelvies, bring back twelvies, such a fun time in my life. I think and also like I'm serious that the term twelvies died with our class. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> It's because we were such twelvies. That's the thing. Like people are cool now. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Like they don't have time to be calling each other names now. I mean like they do, but like they're more like oh, period period period. Anyways, what made you collect shot glasses?</p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Because I like truthfully I saw it in a TikTok. Well, you know how people collect magnets, but then I was like, I don't have my own fridge. So I was like, you know what's great? Shot glasses. Because I want to collect stuff from where I travel too. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> I love that very much. — off topic conversation —  Anyways, I wait, I love that so much and I have so many questions. You're just gonna have to let me think of them, okay? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Okay, no worries. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Because I'm with my interviews, I have just realized I'm really shitty at interviewing, and it just needs to be more of a conversation and it needs to get off track because I can't keep it on track because it's so unnatural for me.  Okay, so I also love to collect things. Huh? What do you collect?  That's so funny you asked because I actually completely lied. I can't think of one thing that I like. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I knew that was coming. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> No, I would say that the way I collect things is like, I'll have like a pair of shoes. like, my fake birkenstocks. Wait. And then what I collect like I'm like, okay, I wore those shoes in Thailand, I've worn them in Hong Kong, I've worn them in America. I have worn them in China. I wore them in Australia, like, I'm like, you know, it's like I'm setting down collecting memories in one objecet. And like my water bottle, it's like with time this is so special it's been to Thailand again So just the collection of one item. Yeah, it's a collection of. Oh my God. Um actually, wait, I lied. I I lied again. I collect things. Oh my God. I like these little guys. I lightly collect things, but I'd say I used to collect things a lot more when I was younger, like littlest pet shops.I will never get rid of that treasure trove. Never said that before in my life. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> My presentation today, I used the word panacea . I never use that word ,panacea.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> the fuck is that. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> What is that? It is like a synonym for a different word, so I just stuck it in my presentation. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Wait, that's like actually I've never heard that way before. I think you're lying to me. You're a collector of big words, aren't you? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> My daddy is a collector of big words. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Is that not like his whole job? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Like English, like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. My mom and dad have diarrhea and they're vomiting. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Both? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Yeah, they're really channeling their inner Isla.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> why? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I don't know, but I think my mom got it? I don't know, because my mom got it on the plane and then she gave it to my dad. Anyway, I really love my shot glasses and seeing where I have been. And I was really tempted to get one, so I got one in London. I thought that the little handle was really nice. Like beer, like England they love to drink. Anyway, that's my collection. I hate that. Yeah. Any more questions?</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Did you collect things when you were young? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Um, I really was into my Polly Pockets. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Oh my God, I love. Do you know those mini Polly Pockets? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> No.  </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> There were like mini mini Polly Pockets. Anyways, do not let me interrupt. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I had the most awesome Polly Pocket fashion runway thing and like there were curtains and so you could stick them on there. I don't know where that went, but I loved it. What else did I collect? Oh, something I actually do collect and I do have more of are shells.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Oh, of course, I love shells. Wow, those are beautiful. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I know they're from the beach in Spain. I've always done that. What else have I collected? I I too, am a hoarder, I think that. I just get really attached to things, I think. Like anything like oh, cards, like birthday cards and the full birthday cards. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Yes. Actually, I don't think I'm a hoarder now.  Like I just don't think I can be classified under that. I used to be a hoarder as a child, but I think that was more because I was really anxious when I was a child. Now I'm a grown woman, you know. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Woman, let me be your woman. I listened to that song recently and I was like, what is this? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Wait, lowkey, that's like my guilty pleasure song. Like, I always pass it on my playlist and I'm like, I cannot listen to it, but I want to. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I remember when we used to go on those runs where I would  have to start first because you were too fast. I thought about that on Saturday and was like wow I really am so weird. Um anyway, so I would like to wait, let me go first. me. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> No, and I respect that. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Um, I just knew my ability anyways, I used to listen to some  “why don't you say so?”</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Remember when we were playing Taylor Swift and dancing and then we looked behind us and there were people right there. Wildest Dreams, that's what I was playing. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Oh, I remember. I know, and see, that's where I think like I think I knew we were actually friends then because like we could do fun things. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> No, I've that's the thing I realize now like who my true friends are because like I am very rambunctious and crazy. I am so crazy! Um, no, but actually, like if someone's my actual friend, I cannot stop talking or like making noise around them or I just become so hyperactive. Oh my God, Are we done with the shot glass or not? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Yes. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Let's move on to the little Spain tie that you had, because I'm curious about that. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Well, so it's a ribbon? Yes, yeah. And so basically, I have a few of them and you can get different patterns. You can get colors and then the Spanish flag. Anyways, so my aunt, I'm not religious, yeah, okay? But my aunt, she goes to church and so at this place in Spain, this church thing, the silica, maybe that's what it's called. I don't really know. It's like big, beautiful building. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> I learned about it in Art History. Five on APAH. sorry, not to gloat.</p>
  
      <p><strong>CSE:</strong> Did you ever check your AP scores after senior year? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Oh, I did. I got like a three on everything. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Wait, that's still passing, though. Anyways, yeah, whatever. She likes to get birds and stuff so there's one on my suitcases and my backpack. And so that one is the Spanish flag one and I have it tied onto my closet and she says it brings you good luck. It's meant to protect you although I do not believe in that religion, I really enjoy these ribbons and it just basically makes me think of her. I love love, love her. She’s a lot older than my mom by 14 years. She's more like a grandma to me. On a nice note because I don't have grandmas, and RIP to them. Both from cancer and both of my grandpa's from cancer too. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Oh my God, cancer's just taking over and we can't be scared. I'm scared. And on that note I'm gonna go eat one of these donut holes that is going to give me cancer. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I think about all the Mami noodles I ate, all that like oh, like I am gonna give myself something. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>  I'm seeing all these people that are like no seed oils. no refined sugar and I'm like lowkey I need, I need to get on that. I've been really bad at eating a bunch of sugar recently because I am falling off.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Well, I remember seeing a TikTok where it's like, you're not meant to eat more than like max one chocolate bar a day. And I remember in Hong Kong like I actually would do a chocolate bar do a bag of gummies, and then later on in the evening I'd have hockey probably do another bag of like some kind of candy and maybe some noodles, like, but I was also like a little bit more fit so maybe I just need to like get back on that.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>  I like my lip is so itchy it's my eczema patch anyways, what the um, like the max sugar we're supposed to intake for a week is 21 grams or something. And like those bitches (the donut holes), it's just in one in one serving, and like if you're eating that plus other sugary things throughout the day, it's like so terrible. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> No, I actually I think have an issue with sugar. Anyways, this is not for this, we're not collecting sugar. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> No, but like you could actually, I bet you you could check my blood sugar and holy shit. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Yeah. Um, what else about this ribbon? Let me think. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Sorry, sorry. So, where did she get them again? What's her name? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Sorry. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Sorry. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> S A R Y. She gets them from that church. She has one waiting for me. This limited edition summer one. It's basically just sitting to protect you and whatever and like people normally put it on their suitcases. And I saw someone on a train here with one on their suitcase and I almost went up to them. Then I was like no no. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> that's so nice. Now you guys have that little connection of like “we're both safe”, </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Literally. God. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> And this is something I talked about with Anna is like, receiving a trinket, like a gift is sometimes so nice because your aunt gave that to you in the religious sense of like, I want to protect Catherine. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> If anyone gets me anything, like, and they thought about me. Like this box of chocolate covered cookies because I said I'd really been wanting some cookies, but I can't justify them. And then I got a parcel at my door, and I was like what is this? It's the box of chocolate. And I was like, that's so nice I almost started crying and I was like no, no, don't don't. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Did Archie boy get those for you? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Arch boy UK, yes. And I kept some of the wrapping. Like, why can't I not just get rid of things? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> No, no, but that's so nice. You should, like put it you know of those people that have those journals and they just like to keep stickers, tickets, and things. You should do that. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Yeah, that's nice. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Don't be ashamed that you're sentimental. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> But it gets to a point where it's like I just have so much stuff. Like why do I have this? Like it's it's a metro ticket and they look exactly the same and I probably have about, at least 15. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Oh yeah, I will say, like, you know, like the Hong Kong Taxi app and the bus service app and the Octopus app. I haven't been able to delete them because I'm like that means I'm fully done with Hong Kong.I think I had to delete a couple of them because I was so out of storage on my phone I couldn't even turn on my phone, but I still have some Hong Kong apps that simply do not serve me a purpose, but I just need to keep them. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> But those notifications are so annoying.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>  I don't have notifications for anything, so I'm out of the loop on that. Aw, who's this little guy? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Selma the Sloth. Aw. He's always… whatever. Um, ribbon, what else could I say? It's on my backpack. Oh, I have another Spanish flag one of on my backpack and it is a pink one. So kind of color-clashing, red and pink, but you know, I love them together. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Um that's awesome. I'm recently really loving some pinks anyways.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong>Speaking of pink, the next thing we can talk about, which is red. That heart thing I have up there? So my cousin, her children made them, there's three of them. They made them for me for my last birthday and last birthday was actually like, for some reason I couldn't stop crying the whole day. But anyway, I got that for my last birthday and I just hung it up because I was like again, I can't get rid of it. It melted plastic, but I can't get rid of it. And it probably took them out two seconds to make, but like it was made from love, they made it for me. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> To be loved is to be seen. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I know, I actually don't know how to have a normal reaction. Anyone else besides my parents that listens to me, I'm like, oh my God my God. yeah. I didn't know what I was. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> That's so nice.  I think I'm maturing because I've always received cards from my grandma and like, I've always been surrounded by love, but I think I'm maturing where I'm now more aware of it and I'm more like this means so much more to me because I'm like observing that I'm so loved. My grandma sent me this card for Easter. She writes “hello, sweetest thing ever.” in her little swirly handwriting.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong>  That's so cute. Like ugh it's so great to feel loved. Oh my God. And like, I think last year I started to send my own cards because my aunt and everyone just always send cards. My aunt sent me Easter cards, Christmas cards, and birthday cards. So I like to make a conscious effort to send cards to everyone. And like it's not like a big thing, but it's like you went out of your way to send it and I'm like wow, they did this too. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Sometimes when I am sitting in my room alone, I wonder if somebody's thinking about me right now, not in a self centered way though. But also like I'm kind of the same like I've made more of an effort to call my grandma or like I was at the park and there was a Bluejay and whenever I see a bluejay, I think of my grandma just because like at their old house in Wisconsin, there was a bunch of birds in the backyard and my grandpa loved all the animals so he'd feed them. And my grandma would always point out the bluejays and so I sent a picture to my grandma and told her that the bluejay made me think of her. And she was like, that is so nice of you to think about me. And then I was thinking about that and I'm like, that is so nice.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong>  I know, my dad said to me, it's your job to have a relationship with your aunts and your cousins. It is fully on you now, you can't hide behind your parents and whatever. So I feel like I've really made an effort. and I like to call them. I don't know if you had more questions about the melted plastic. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> No, if you want to move on, this is your space. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I have to remember what the other things are. Oh, one was the picture frame of Okay, so basically, I made two different things for my mom's birthday. So I got this picture frame with the printed paw and then there's a clay version - which everyone likes better. And I thought, I'll give it to my mom... I didn't. Because I kept the one which looked better. And like, oh my God, Isla got so many white hairs by her eyes now, and I looked at a photo from Christmas and I am, oh my God. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> How old is she now? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> August 17th will be um let me do some math really quick. 12 years since we got her, so she's 13 now. I've been telling everyone she is 13 for like two years now. She will probably be 14 now. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Wow. She's an old girl. I remember because we used to do our walks where we'd buy a bunch of sugar and be crazy, and we'd go sit at Red Hill. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I'm just like I was literally the healthiest I've been my whole life </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Well, it's because we were running like three miles or more every day. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> We were insane. but I'm hiking and it was so fun. It was so fun. I missed it. Hong Kong was the best. Hong Kong was the best with you.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> But I was gonna say, Soso, she's a rescue so she has no idea how to play with other dogs. You know her, she's like the most awkward dog in the world, she barely knows how to play with toys. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I have this one really vivid memory from when we were on a hike and she had just been groomed and then we were walking and there were some dead worms or mud on the ground and she rubbed her face into them.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Oh my god ya, they were dead worms and that is the most dog thing she's ever done. Like other than that, Soso is not a dog. She's so weird. And I remember  she and Ila would play and chase each other around. And it was very short because Soso would get overwhelmed. But like Isla is the only dog. Except for Shiba Inus, she loves Shiba Inus she actually freaks out for a Shiba Inu.  But like Isla's one of the only dogs that Soso has ever actually played with like that. And I remember being like, oh my God, this is so cute. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> My profile photo on Apple, like on my apple devices is still a photo of me, holding both of the dog' faces, like squatted over I don't know, yeah. I missed Tai Tam country park. I just miss really specific things, but then again, I like to start to think about it and I could not imagine having to go through another year of highschool.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> I miss it and all that, but I'm like, it ended. But also I do miss like just like hanging out and like going to get fucking burritos and then sitting at home and like just screaming.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I don't really miss being insanely sweaty. Like I was thinking about this the other day and was like, I don't know how I didn't smell more, or was everyone smelling and like we just all accepted it. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> I can't really remember. I don't know maybe like all of our bodies adjusted. But also some of these bitches were not sweating and I'm like guys? I am dripping. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Like I was actually constantly wet. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> No, like literally I am so sweaty and like it's so disgusting. New York gets just as hot as Hong Kong and it's just as humid and it's so disgusting. But like whatever. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> So how did we really get from the melted plastic heart to this? Oh, anyway, so then I made two separate things for Anas birthday and then I kept one. You can like just say I kept one, don't say I kept the nicer one. It is just a reminder of my beautiful dog and I love that dog so much and and I've grown up with that dog and so when that dog dies, I die, like I'm not joking.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>I will go with that dog.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> My mom showed me her on Zoom today and I was like oh my god. But she went to the vet, the vet in Stanley, the one that you used to go to.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>The vet in Stanley squeezed my dog's anal glands. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Oh, my dog's anal glands have also been squeezed there. That's why she was so itchy, like you remember that when she had like a chunk of hair missing? she was itchy. But yeah, so just reminds me of my dog and I miss that dog and I actually sometimes just have the urge to pet a dog while I'm sat by my desk because you would always come and sit with me and I just have the urge pet her, but she's not here. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>I have the same thing, I just want to grab my pet's face and I would always clean my pet's eye boogers with my hands and my mom would also say you need to use a napkin. And I'm like, no, I will go in bare handed because these are my children. And I know nobody's doing it now that I'm not there and I just like to just clean their eye boogers, okay?! In a cute way, okay?!, </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I think when she dies it will be so like oh my God, let us not think about it. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> I mean, I just think about it in a way where it's like I've grown up with my cats for so long and as I get older, this is about to get deep and dark, okay? As I get older, I'm just thinking about these things that I've had since my childhood. Like my grandma. My grandma, my cats, my like I have this blanket that my grandma got me when I was really young and I would suck my thumb </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> My parents hated when I suck my thumb, sorry I'll say this and then you can get back to your story. On my bunk that I had a desk underneath of,I remember I'd bite off the spicy nail polish and then spit from the top of the bunk onto the floor so that I could suck my fucking thumb. Let me suck my fucking thumb!</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> I just think about these things and like as I get older they like you know, they're gonna die or they're gonna disappear. And like obviously I'm just growing up and leaving my childhood, but there's like these physical objects from my childhood that I know like once my cats die or like my grandma dies, like that's going to be like, oh shit, like, I'm grown, you know, it's over, over. And that's it. And I hate that so much. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I remember when we were at Elisa's uncle's apartment by the industrial and he had like NFTs, whatever. I remember when we were all sobbing when everyone was leaving and I said, and I still believe, that  I didn't think this could happen to me. because I think just like growing up as a child and this is probably like, wow I had a great childhood like I was riddled with anxiety and like obsessive thoughts, maybe, but still, I had such a great childhood that like, I just like I never thought I would grow up. I just didn't realize and it's actually devastating, </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> In that moment, I actually thought my world was ending. Like I'm not joking. I think it was also because your childhood is ending. Like that moment like you all saying goodbye, I actually never felt heartbreak like that. Like it really like my heart physically hurt. Like it in a way it was like a world was ending. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Yeah, that's like we're moving away from our families, from school, from all of our friends, like that is like your world is ending. You have to completely recreate a new one, which is overwhelming and too much. And maybe that's why we hold on to these objects. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Exactly. But in this case,I really like how I can see, I don't know if a photo did it justice, but on the paw print part where it's in ink, I can see every little hair.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Yeah, yes, yes. Wait, but one more thing, cause I just need to talk. I always think about when my pets die, like how am I gonna remember them? Because like, unless I fucking taxidermy those bitches, like, how the fuck am I gonna do that? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> There's a few months like last year when I think I was really going through it where I was like, I'm going to taxidermy Isla. But then I've moved past it, because I thought to myself, that's cruel. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> That's like cruel and like, where the fuck are you gonna put the taxidermy? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> In my bed of course. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Dude, that's like that's scary, but it's fine. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> I know, but then I like, I do think to myself I want to have her little name tag thing. But then I think to myself, she's really just my dad's dog, like, really, like, really truly, like she loves him the most and they have spent the most time together. So I don't even think I have the right to like start claiming things, you know? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> You are remembering her. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Yeah. Oh, my dad actually I think will be distraught. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Well, like when Pancakes dies, like what will my dad do? Like the thing with my dad is like he's very like man and like also just like the way he was brought up. It's very like, all right, next, which is cruel, but like that's just the way he thinks. It's like, I don't know, but like, if I were him, I would be fucking sobbing and dying on the floor. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong>I think these I think, well, going back to what you said, I think, like, the pets, especially even if I get other pets that kind of replace, we'll not replace her, but like I have other pets in the future like even when they die well I'm like speaking a little too soon. But I'll be sad, but I actually think this will be like a heartbreak. Because it's like, oh my God. and then I'll think about all the times I was too lazy to walk her far and only walked her to the corner. I keep thinking about this constantly. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>I always like I'll be so lazy laying in my bed and the door would be closed and like I can just hear So crying outside or like Blueberry, she would like yowl outside, and I'm like I should just let them in. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> But then like you just have they don't. But also, you know what? The amount of times I have given them love and just been there for them just surpasses the amount of times I have not let them into my room. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>The connection between animals and humans is so crazy because I remember at home whenever I would leave for school my parents would say that Soso would be in dead dog mode laying by the door waiting for me. And then whenever I would get home, they said any time I was coming up from the elevator, she'd just like perk up and just start standing by the door. And it's not like she can fucking hear me. We're on the 23rd floor. Anyways, let's move on to your keychain. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Okay, so my key chain? It's in case you wanted to know what it feels like, it's a little bit wooden. So basically it's like a round little piece of wood that's been burned. Like a design has been burnt into it, which sounds not great, but whatever. Anyways, circling back to my aunt, we went to this little market that was held in this town. Voice memo are you listening? We have a house in Spain, right? And so it's like a little small town and then there's like a market once a year and it's called the Medieval market, but it's not medieval. It's not as fun as you think. There's just little stalls by the castle. Anyways, and this was like the week before I left after this past summer. And so they had these key chains and that's the name of the town and then there's like a witch on a broom because the little symbol of the town is like a witch on a broom so at home we also have a magnet for that. And my aunt was like, something to remember me by. She bought me that little keychain, so I have it on my backpack. It really doesn't go with my gray backpack, but I thought, you know what, this overrides fashion.</p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>I love that, that is so nice. That you just wait, that's something I  used to collect keychains. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Yeah. and I remember I had a bunch on my school backpack, and they used to jingle jingle too much, so I took them off. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>Oh I love when my keychains jingle jingle.  I have a volleyball keychain on my backpack. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Oh, a memory of t when you were having a good time in the past. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Anyways, Do you have any last words for the judges? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> Love you guys. Thinking of you and loving you! </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> I actually have a 62% in this class because I forgot to submit everything. Let's freaking get it. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong> It will all work out in the end, okay? </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong> Yes, I submitted them all today. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>CSE:</strong>Okay, anyway. </p>
  
      <p> <strong>TD:</strong>goodbye recording</p>

          <p><strong>Temperance Downing:</strong> No, I don't. </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>Okay, so these little notebooks?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Oh, Ive seen those things.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Yeah, and Im obsessed with them, and I love them.And so I have like a collection of a bunch of them.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Did you buy them or did you get them like like made like specifically for you?  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> No, no. These are like this is like the brand and then they have like special addition ones so they made a collection of like airline ones, there was a diner, there was like a couple ones and then my favorite was like the airlines one. so I got that one. This one's Kyoto edition. I love that one. This one is Taiwanese beer, and then it has like a charm, but I don't have the charm on here, but um and then this has like a plane charm.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Cool. 
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> And then this one is um my brother got this for me from China and it has my name in it in like, Mandarin. like no, it's not like my name because obviously my name isn’t Mandarin, but it's like the characters that sound closest to my name. And it was a necklace and then I lost the thing, but then I put it on the notebook. so cute. um and then on the inside, I have like my journals. . So, I don't know, is this like a good thing to do? like pick different different things.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  No, these are perfect.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Okay. but there's like eight of them. Should I choose my favorites?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Yeah, or we can do all eight, like oh, it's up to you, really.When did you start collecting them?  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Okay, so I actually have another one that's not um the official traveler's company. I got that when I was either a junior or a senior in high school. So, like about let's say 16. And because I couldn't afford to get, like the actual traveler' company because they're really kind of expensive. They're like $60 for a plane one. and for, like, the fancy ones, um, they're about like $100 they usually sell out quickly and then they get resold for like four or $500. So, I got one that was just a leather brand and I, you know, got them to make it for me for $20 and even got them to stamp my name in it. but then Ive always wanted like the official company ones, because they also come with like writing boards and then they have like stickers and stamps and and like these little folders and just all sorts of, you know, different, even like these clips, and I just really love the brand, like, this is the standard size one of the folders. And so, I couldn't afford it when I was like, in high school and then when I l started to, you know, become a little bit more of an adult, I started to spend my actual money on it.This is another writing board.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> Wait, so what is a writing board? Is that just like  </p>
  
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>oh, okay, so let me explain to you the story. So basically, it started off for Japanese businessmen to travel and write their notes or write whatever, like they needed for their travels, right? It's called the traveler's notebook. And then, the journaling community and people who are into stationary and this kind of thing, kind of took on the snow because it's beautiful, and the leather's gorgeous and everything. and they started making all of these accessories for the journaling community. I don't know if the writing word existed before or after the journal and community, like in this notebook, but basically it's like you're on the go and it's hard to write, so you put this underneath your page and go. you put it underneath your page, and so this is like a notebook, right?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Yeah.  </p>
          
            <p><strong>IG:</strong> And like even like the page, like the front page with like the beautiful frame I'm obsessed with it. They put it underneath your page, and you get, I know this is like the worst way to show that.  </p>
          
            <p><strong> TD:</strong>  it's okay.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> So not only do you, like, see the lines, I don't know if you can see.So that's what the writing board is.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Oh, oh my, that's cool! </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>  Yeah, so each year they come out with a new collection where there's a writing board for the standard, and for the passport size. So the passport size, you can actually fit your passport in it. And so these two are from the same year, this is from 2018  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Wow.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> And then this is the standard size like the colors on this one. Yeah, let me see if I have some of my other ones that I can show you. Oh, and then the nice thing about these traveler's notebooks is that there's an elastic band here, right? And there's a bookmark and an elastic band, the elastic band. What you do is you can get like another rubber band. They have like sets of them, and then you put it in between one page of the notebook and then on the other side, you put the other one, so then they kind of become attached like this. Does that make sense? And then you put that underneath the rubber band, so it's like that. But then you can carry two notebooks, if you want three, and you put the third one, like, you open this in half, and then you put the third one through that, like that. And you can just keep stacking as many as you want. Some people like it really chunky, some people like it on the slimmer side. I like a mixture of both, to be honest. Let me show you, um oh, this is another writing board. This is from 2021.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Wow, so pretty.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>Let me see if I have oh, and then I know I have more writing boards. Let me see if I can find some.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> These are so cool, though. I remember, um there was this Instagram account. I think it's, um from Europe though. And they are very expensive, but they have like these whole sessions where you go in and you get to customize it and it's so satisfying. They have like ASMR videos of it and it's so satisfying.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> I love that.. I'm lowkey thinking that I lost one of my notebooks, I'll just like kill myself. But like, I'll go out with my friends and, like, I went to this museum and I got this postcard. And then I just like printed photos of me with my friends, so cool and wrote about it. This is actually like my parson's challenge, my parson's portfolio.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Wow, cool.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> And then, this was my parson's challenge. It was actually a video and I was like, this is kind of ripped up and I'll fix it. I didn't know how to showcase the video, so, like, I kind of made, like, this like  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  wait, that's so cool.So this is from when you were applying to Parsons?  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Yeah, look, I kind of use it like a scrapbook, like journal.. This is okay, I like I'm missing one of my notebooks, actually.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Do you like, like do you bring them around, do you have a specific one that you bring around, or is it just like you like to fill one up and then go to the next?  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>No, cause I love to switch them around. I think they're so fun. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I did not. I'm not missing my journal, I found out. Okay, so this is another yeah, so I like to sometimes I like to switch out, like the folders. I do have like, they're like set in groups, so like, for example, this one that I'm currently using, the black one, with the charm. Oh Another thing, like, with this one is, not this one, like all of them. Each one has a corresponding rubber band, so they all come when you unpackage it, because the packaging is beautiful, because obviously, like Japanese packaging stunning. when you unbox it, they all come with the rubber band that's the same exact color. So like this one is the olive green one and comes with the dark green rubber band. This and then each one has a corresponding rubber band color that matches it slowly perfectly. So, for example, the black one has the red rubber band, the brown one has the rubber band like, do you see how? It is so the um camel one has the green rubber band. So, um these are like the originals, just like the plain ones, and the plane ones come in like the pastor size and like, the bigger size. but then one year they came out with, um this like special like collection collaboration collection thing where if the travelers company had a diner, if they had a um airlines, if they had a record, such music company, and there was one more, I forget which what it was um oh like a train or automobile company. I can't remember what the fourth one. But um how they would like design like the notebooks. so my favorite were the airline ones, which I showed you and then the notebook that I couldn't find was the diner one. and like look at the little this is upside down. Also, these are all like embossed. The Kyoto one is like embossed. </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  It's so beautiful.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>It has like, what is this called, a foiling?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> Yes.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>and then this one, it's got like the little car that likes to drive. </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>   That's so cute.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>And it has a little tree down here with it up. And then this one has uh the airline one has like a tag. but uh this is my current, like, most used one. Okay, so you open it and then it's like, some photos with me and my friends, and then these are like, this is like one of the things that they have. It's like this pocket thing. and then on the other side, I just have like, just some, like, stationary bits and bobs that I enjoy. and then this is like daily journaling. and this is just, like the way that I decorated it. Oh, and then these are some more writing boards. This is from the year 2023. Wow. Isn't it gorgeous?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> So pretty.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>And then this is from the year 2020, I think? 2020, yeah. And then more journal pages with things like stationary bits and bobs. And then this is my, like, monthly planner, but I've used this like in 2024 and 2025. And I just love the cluttered look. but then I like to fill up the space with things. This is a sticker that I designed. for me. of and it's like a journal spread. I don't know if you could tell.. It's like the journal spread open like this, like do you see how this is open? And then I printed it down on sticker paper, and then I also made this clip.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> Oh my God, so cute.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>And then, um so this is when I first started it, this is my goal. Oh, and then I designed this, which is like a stationary box.  And these are some stamps that I have that I love. So, like whenever I get new stickers or whatever, I just pop them in here, this is a sticker my friend gave me. This is a bird stamp that I got. This is a classic. </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> Yeah. Wait, and I remember in space and materiality you brought in those stickers.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>Oh yeah.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> Weren’t you gonna start like a little stationary business or something like that?  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> I was. I actually it's funny cause like um today I was walking oh, and then there's just stationary in here. It's funny cause today I was walking out of a Union square and I saw a bunch of people selling their stuff and I stopped this guy who was selling stuff and I asked him like hey, do you need a permit for this? And we start pitchatting and he basically tells me like, it's like first come first serve you find a spot and you sell yourself. So I was thinking about getting a bunch of friends and we can set up like a table and just like sell things that we design. and he was like, you know, you kind of do need a permit, but kind of don't at the same time. He's like, every now and then a police officer will come and be like, you gotta get up and pack your shit. But most of the time they just don't care.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> I know that it's more of a problem with the police interfering at Washington Square Park.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Really? </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Yeah, like there's like there's like a bunch of artists. I'm pretty sure there was a whole thing where artists were protesting being like let us sell our things at the Park.I feel like the police are more active at Washington Square Park. They're a bit more annoying there.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Yeah. yeah. Yeah, and then he was like the best days to come are on Saturdays when, um when what's it called? uh when it's like the farmer's market, cause they get a lot of tourists. And you know, I was thinking like, a lot of us are making shit anyways, might as well just like sell it,you know, if we make 50 bucks a day, it's 50 bucks that we didn't have the day before, you know, like why not? So, I don't know, would you be interested in  in partaking in that?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> Yeah. I mean, like I don't know what I would I could make like posters for it to like advertise it.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Or like, you know, even like that font that you made, I feel like what you can do like, didn't you say you wanted to make that into magnets?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> Oh yeah, or like stickers, yeah, I could sell that.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong>Or making into stickers, or making it into like would be cool I don't know if you'd be down for this. But, um do you know what a shrinky dink is?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> Yes, I know Shrinky dink is.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Wouldn't that be sick?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  That would be so cute.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Right? Like in a little you don't have to make like a ton, you don't have to make like stock, I just think it'd be fun.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> That would be so fun.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> Right?  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> Yeah. Wait, you need to make this happen.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> No, I definitely. I think probably towards like the end of summer though, cause I'm gonna be going to Michigan and a lot of people are leaving. but yeah, I wanna make prints too. I've been really into freaking sardines. I love sardines, and I wanna just make a bunch of sardine art.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> From Washington Square Park, there's this one person, they make amazing printmaking. I have it on my wall, I'm gonna send you a picture after this, but it's so beautiful. It's like hands cutting a fish and it's intricate, like printmaking and I got it from Washington Square Park. It's so beautiful.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> You know what I was thinking about and maybe you could do this too, if you're interested, we could both do this. I was thinking about designing some like letter writing paper and then using a bunch of the freshman's printing point or like the Lang kids print points. At the end of the year a lot of people just like to lose on most of the print points. and then use the pro color paper, like the nice paper and turn it into like memo pads.And then like the design lab has like that paper trimmer, not like just the guillotine, but it has the one that chops it all off like the. yeah, like And so it'll look really nice and neat and all we have to do is get some binder clips and glue like the top part. </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong> You are so creative and resourceful with these stationary things. I love it. it's like you're so excited about it and I love it so much.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> I don't know, cause I'm not excited about selling fashion, I don't wanna monetize it.  </p>
          
          <p><strong> TD:</strong>  Yeah. It's just like a hobby.  </p>
          
          <p><strong>IG:</strong> I think I think it's more of something that I'm good at, I don't know if I feel passionate about it anymore. but like, but that's not true, cause I just still think I'm passionate about it cause like, when I wanna make things like and I love when I have the passion and the desire to make something, or when I get back into creating and I'm using my hands and I'm just like sculpting things on the dress form, it's so fun for me. I love it, and I'm so and I get so excited and I have so many ideas. But then when it's like, you gotta make a technical skirt and do like a zipper, you know, whatever, it sucks, I know you understand, like, we were talking about it.  </p>
          
         <p><strong> TD:</strong> No, I like I get that so much.

I used to suck my thumb and my parents tried to make me stop by stealing my blankets, but telling me it was the tooth fairy. I had a winnie the pooh blanket before this one, and one day I lost a tooth and my blanket was gone. I remember sobbing until I threw up and then I found my pink blanket and started to get really stressed when one of my teeth would fall out. I started leaving threatening messages to the tooth fairy whenvere I lost a tooth, and my pink blanket never went missing and I have had it till this day! My next object is a Littlest Pet Shop. I grew up playing with these, I took LPS very seriously and played with them long after all my freinds stopped playing with them. I used to have whole set ups of houses in the middle of our living room at home and sometimes I think about how nice it was that my parents stepped over it and let me keep them up for a week before telling me to clean it all up. </p>"
